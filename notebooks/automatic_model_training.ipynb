    "This notebook demonstrates how to train custom openWakeWord models using pre-defined datasets, an automated process for synthetic data generation/augmentation, and a custom training process. While not guaranteed to always produce the best performing model, the methods shown in this notebook often produce baseline models with relatively strong performance.\n",

    "- Early-stopping and checkpoint averaging (similar to [stochastic weight averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407)) to search for the best models found during training, according to the validation data\n",
    "- Variable learning rates with cosine decay and multiple cycles\n",
    "- Adaptive batch construction to focus on only high-loss examples when the model begins to converge, combined with gradient accumulation to ensure that batch sizes are still large enough for stable training\n",
    "- Cycical weight schedules for negative examples to help the model reduce false-positive rates\n",
